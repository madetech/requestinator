# Requestinator

This repo allows sales and delivery managers request for resources for client projects. The app uses Google form to allow users to send requests, which is then sent to a Google sheet where operations will manage and reply to the requests. The emailing system is done within Google sheets with a script which is triggered every time a checkbox is updated and when operations reply with a response. In addition to this a weekly email is sent every Monday with a list of the past weeks requests to update sales on the progress of the overall resource allocation.
